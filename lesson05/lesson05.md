# Lesson 5

[Lesson 5](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-5-official-topic/96491) did not contain too many new topics for me, but instead of moving on fast, I resisted the temptation and did a bit of recapping.

I returned to the titanic competition for working on EDA, feature engineering and also building a Fast.AI model. I explored how I could co-work with ChatGPT on this task. As a result I created the following notebooks:

* [Titanic EDA and 1R with ChatGPT](https://www.kaggle.com/code/christianwittmann/titanic-eda-and-1r-with-chatgpt)): The goal of this notebook is to create a 1R-model ([One Rule](https://datacadamia.com/data_mining/one_rule), also see related [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022631118932)) of the Titanic Kaggle Competition after doing EDA ([Exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)), supported by ChatGPT.
* [Titanic Feature Engineering and Model Creation with ChatGPT](https://www.kaggle.com/code/christianwittmann/titanic-feature-engineering-fast-ai-model-creation)): The goal of this notebook is do some feature engineering on the dataset of the Titanic Kaggle Competition and to later create a Fast.AI-`learner` to submit the result to Kaggle, supported by ChatGPT.

I also wrote about my thoughts on working with ChatGPT and what I have learned along the way in [this blog post](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2023-03-05-titanic-with-chatgpt/).

Still on the bucket list for further research / things to be done while moving on:

* Transfer to [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview) including Feature engineering
* Watch lesson 4 + 6 and 7 of the 2020 version (which is the book)
