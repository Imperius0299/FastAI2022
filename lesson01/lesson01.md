# Lesson 1 of Fast.AI 2022 Edition

The first lesson is very much about "playing the whole game" (insert link): Without going into any details, we are creating a computer vision classifier - isn't that cool!

## My learning approach

After watching the video,

* My first exercise was to play with Jeremy'a notebook "Is it a bird?". After running it on the Kaggle platform, I also ran it on my local computer, here is the resulting [notebook](/lesson01/bird_or_not/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb)
* To go beyond the "Is it a bird?", I decided to build a model which can identify if a picture shows a cat or a dog. Somehow I felt, that is a mandatory exercise for a ML student ;)

Anything beyond that, I postponed to later, knowing that the course will dig deeper in the next lessons.

## Lessons learned

The actual implementation in analogy was not too hard, but there were some challenges on the way. Here are some of my learnings:

* "Cat or Dog" is more difficult than "Bird or Forest": I had to experiment a bit with the dataset until it really produced good results, i.e. to get the test images to be classified with enough confidence
