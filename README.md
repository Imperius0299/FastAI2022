# FastAI2022

In this repo I am documenting my learning journey of the 2022 version of the Fast.AI course (2022 edition).

Watching the videos is one thing, but to truly understand, many more hours of practice are needed.

So far, I have done the following lessons

* [Lesson 1](/lesson01/lesson01.md)
* [Lesson 2](/lesson02/lesson02.md)
